BMI Calculator

This project is developed as part of the Oasis Infobyte Python Programming Internship.

Description:
The BMI Calculator is a simple Python program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) using user-provided height and weight.

Formula Used:
BMI = Weight (kg) / (Height (m) × Height (m))

BMI Categories:
- Underweight: BMI < 18.5
- Normal weight: 18.5 ≤ BMI < 25
- Overweight: 25 ≤ BMI < 30
- Obese: BMI ≥ 30

Technology Used:
Python

Working:
The program takes height and weight as input from the user, calculates the BMI using the standard formula, and displays the BMI value along with the corresponding health category.
